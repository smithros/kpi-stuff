### About:
In this repository you can find some works, I made during studying in the university from 2017 to 2023. <br/>

I was done in National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute” <br/>
Speciality: 123 - Computer Engineering. Bachelor's and Master's degrees.

All works variants are 7 or 8 for bachelor and 5 for masters, but there is a chance that these tasks are not actual now.<br>

I do not guarantee that they all work correctly, but it was enough to get a satisfying mark (B and A grades in ECTS system). </br>
So I hope it could be useful for you. </br>

If you need not only code but also protocols (not all subjects required code), soon you will be able to find it on Google Drive with "palevo" that you all know.

### How to use:
To clone the repo for using these materials simply do the following: </br>
`git clone https://github.com/smithros/kpi-stuff.git`

### Note 
A lot of code here could be written better, but there was no time for this :)
