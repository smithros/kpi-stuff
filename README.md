In this repository you can find some works, i made during studying in the university.<br>
All works variants are 7 or 8, but there is a chance that these tasks are not actual now.<br>

I do not guarantee that they all work correctly, but it's was enough to get a satisfying mark, so I hope it could be useful for you.<br>
If you need not only code but also protocols (not all subjects required code), soon you will be able to find it on google drive with "palevo" that you all know.

To clone the repo simply do the following:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/smithros/kpi-stuff.git`
<br>If you have some questions please DM me.
